# VolunteeringWebsite

This is a Volunteering Web Application for my bachelor thesis. The main technologies used are ASP.NET Core, MS SQL Server and some javascript.
The website stores and manages volunteering projects and vacancies. The user is able to participate to them.

Note: the contributor is sergheicodrean because I was working from my brother's laptop.
